# Threads
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Overview

Threads is a web application built with Next.js and MongoDB, designed to facilitate threaded discussions among users. This project provides a platform where users can create threads, post replies, and engage in discussions on various topics.

## Features

- **Thread Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete threads.
- **Reply System**: Post and manage replies within threads.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for threads by title or content.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
